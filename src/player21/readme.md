# Player21

I made this player to clean up the code and make it neater. Toward this end I implemented a new Comms system and new targeting, but when I fought it against player20 it would always lose.

I then copied over player21 to player22 and started trying to make player21's targeting and micro identical with player20 to see why it would always win.
